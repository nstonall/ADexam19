\subsection*{Greedy Algorithm}
A greedy algorithm always makes the local choice that looks best at the moment.
In the same way as DP the solution consist of several subsolutions. It can be
solved recursively or iteratively. We will now look at a iterative greedy
algorithm.

\subsection*{Algorithm: Huffman Codes}
The Huffman algorithm finds the optimal prefix code for a character based on
the frequency. It can reduce the size of a file from $20$ \% to $90$ \%. It
reduces the amount of bits needed to represent a given character, by letting
the most frequent characters be represented by the least amount of bits. It is
an iterative greedy algorithm.
\subsubsection*{Example}
 \begin{figure}[H]

   \caption{Huffman example with string \texttt{noah}}
 \end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Runtime: $O(n\log n)$ (set of \texttt{n} characteres)}
We assume that, when Huffmans is excecuted that the data is structered as a
binary min-heap. Building the min-heap using the \texttt{BUILD-MIN-HEAP}
procedure, will take $O(n)$ time. In order to make our greedy choice, we wish
to use the \texttt{EXTRACT-MIN} operation, which takes $O(\lg n)$ time. This is
done $n-1$ times and the algorithm returns a call to \texttt{EXTRACT-MIN},
and in the end the heap operation is called $n$ times. Hence the algorithm runs
in $O(n\lg n)$.

\subsubsection*{Correctness - Proof by greedy choice property}
In order to prove that the greedy choice is the optimal choice we will prove
Huffman codes using the greedy choice property.
\newline\newline
Let $C$ be an alpabet where every character $c\in C$ has a frequency $f_c$. Let
$x,a\in C$ and $f_x\leq f_a$. There exists an optimal parse tree $T$, where $a$
is at the max depth of the tree.\newline\newline

\begin{align*}
  T=OPT\\
  T':T \textrm{ but where a greedy choice places $x$ at the bottom of the tree
  and replaces $a$.}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  B(T')&=B(T)-f_a\cdot d_T(a)-f_x\cdot d_T(x)
  +f_a\cdot d_T(x)+f_x\cdot d_T(a)\\
  &=B(T)+(f_a-f_x)(d_T(x)-d_T(a))\\
  (f_a-f_x)\geq0&\textrm{ Because $f_a$ is larger than $f_x$}\\
  (d_T(x)-d_T(a))\leq0&\textrm{ Because $d_T(a)$ is the maximum depth and
  therefore larger than $d_T(x)$.}\\
  (f_a-f_x)(d_T(x)-d_T(a))\leq0&\textrm{ Because of multiplication rules.}\\
  B(T')&\leq B(T) \Rightarrow T'\textrm{ is optimal}
\end{align*}
Therefore the greedy choice is the most optimal.
